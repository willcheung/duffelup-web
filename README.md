DuffelUp.com is a collaborative and visual trip planner for travelers and travel agents.

## Why I built it
Back in 2009, there was no google sheets or any collaborative tools. Trip planning was either non-existent or consists of an Excel spreadsheet being emailed around. I personally enjoy planning out an outline of all the must-see's / must-do's, organize hotel and flight info, and share itinerary with fellow travelers and friends who's visiting the same destinations. Then duffelup.com was born.

## Features
* Corkboard-like visual trip planning canvas, with drag & drop
* Invite friends to add ideas
* Bookmarklet to "clip" ideas from other websites onto the corkboard
* Map view (via Google Maps) to see where all the destinations / hotels / restaurants are
* Print itinerary - great for traveling abroad

## Social Features
* Any itineray can be private or public. Public itineraries can be copied or used as template.
* Itineraries are grouped by cities
* Each city has "ideas" and things you can add to your itinerary - like TripAdvisor

## Notes
* Built on an old stack in 2009 - Rails 2, MySQL, EC2
* The value of this service is its user-generated content, which was sold when the company got acquired.
